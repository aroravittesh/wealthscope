🌍 WealthScope
A Full‑Stack Portfolio Analytics and Intelligence Platform
🔹 Comprehensive Project Description (Strong One)
WealthScope is a full‑stack, cloud‑ready web application designed to provide structured portfolio analysis and data‑driven financial insights through modern software engineering practices. The project focuses on building a scalable, maintainable, and production‑style system that integrates frontend development, backend APIs, relational databases, machine learning, and DevOps workflows into a cohesive platform.

The system allows users to securely create and manage stock portfolios, analyze historical performance, assess portfolio risk, and receive interpretable insights generated through analytical and machine learning models. Rather than focusing on trading or price prediction, WealthScope emphasizes engineering quality, transparency of analytics, and real‑world system design.

The application is implemented using Angular with TypeScript for the frontend, Go (Golang) with Gorilla Mux for backend RESTful APIs, a SQL database for persistent storage, and a Python‑based machine learning microservice for analytics and insights. The entire system is containerized using Docker, integrated with CI/CD pipelines, and deployed on AWS, reflecting modern industry practices.

This project is developed as part of an undergraduate software engineering curriculum at the University of Florida and is intended to demonstrate applied knowledge of full‑stack development, distributed systems, and collaborative software engineering.

🎯 Motivation & Problem Context
Many portfolio analysis tools available today either:

Hide analytical logic behind black‑box systems, or
