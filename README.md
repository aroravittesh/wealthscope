Project Description
The Stock Portfolio Intelligence Platform (Wealthscope) is a full-stack web application developed to demonstrate core software engineering principles, including system design, modular architecture, database management, machine learning integration, and cloud deployment.

The system enables users to manage stock portfolios, analyze historical performance, and receive data-driven insights through a clean and scalable architecture. The project emphasizes engineering rigor, maintainability, and extensibility rather than financial speculation or trading.

The application is implemented using Angular for the frontend, Go (Golang) for backend RESTful services, a SQL database for persistence, and a Python-based machine learning microservice for analytics. The system is containerized and deployed using modern DevOps practices.

--------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement
Existing portfolio tools often obscure analytical logic and provide limited transparency into how insights are generated. Additionally, many student projects lack real-world architectural depth and deployment considerations.

This project addresses these limitations by:
- Designing a clear, modular system architecture
- Providing explainable analytics
- Applying industry-standard software engineering practices
- Demonstrating end-to-end system deployment

--------------------------------------------------

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Apply software engineering principles to design and implement a full-stack system
- Develop RESTful APIs using Go with proper separation of concerns
- Design and implement a relational database schema
- Integrate machine learning services into a production-style architecture
- Implement CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployment
- Demonstrate teamwork, documentation quality, and version control practices

--------------------------------------------------

Functional Requirements
- User registration and authentication
- Portfolio creation and management
- Stock holding tracking
- Portfolio performance analytics
- ML-based insight generation
- Visualization of analytics via dashboards

--------------------------------------------------

Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability through modular services
- Maintainability via clean code and documentation
- Security through authentication and access control
- Reliability via containerization and CI/CD
- Portability through cloud-ready deployment

--------------------------------------------------

System Architecture
The system follows a layered, service-oriented architecture consisting of:
- Presentation Layer: Angular frontend handling user interaction and visualization
- Application Layer: Go backend exposing RESTful APIs
- Data Layer: SQL database for persistent storage
- Analytics Layer: Python ML microservice for portfolio insights

--------------------------------------------------

Machine Learning Component
Machine learning is used as a decision-support tool rather than a predictive trading engine.

The models analyze historical data to:
- Assess portfolio risk
- Evaluate diversification
- Classify volatility trends

The focus is on explainability, reproducibility, and system integration, aligning with academic best practices.

--------------------------------------------------

Software Engineering Practices Demonstrated
- Modular system design
- REST API best practices
- Database normalization
- Version control using Git
- Agile sprint-based development
- CI/CD automation
- Cloud deployment

--------------------------------------------------
