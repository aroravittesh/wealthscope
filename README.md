🔹 Project Description 
The Stock Portfolio Intelligence Platform is a full‑stack web application developed to demonstrate core software engineering principles, including system design, modular architecture, database management, machine learning integration, and cloud deployment.

The system enables users to manage stock portfolios, analyze historical performance, and receive data‑driven insights through a clean and scalable architecture. The project emphasizes engineering rigor, maintainability, and extensibility, rather than financial speculation or trading.

This application is implemented using Angular for the frontend, Go (Golang) for backend RESTful services, a SQL database for persistence, and a Python‑based machine learning microservice for analytics. The system is containerized and deployed using modern DevOps practices.

🔹 Problem Statement 
Existing portfolio tools often obscure analytical logic and provide limited transparency into how insights are generated. Additionally, many student projects lack real‑world architectural depth and deployment considerations.

This project addresses these limitations by:

Designing a clear, modular system architecture

Providing explainable analytics

Applying industry‑standard software engineering practices

Demonstrating end‑to‑end system deployment

🔹 Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Apply software engineering principles to design and implement a full‑stack system

Develop RESTful APIs using Go with proper separation of concerns

Design and implement a relational database schema

Integrate machine learning services into a production‑style architecture

Implement CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployment

Demonstrate teamwork, documentation quality, and version control practices

🔹 Functional Requirements
User registration and authentication

Portfolio creation and management

Stock holding tracking

Portfolio performance analytics

ML‑based insight generation

Visualization of analytics via dashboards

🔹 Non‑Functional Requirements
Scalability through modular services

Maintainability via clean code and documentation

Security through authentication and access control

Reliability via containerization and CI/CD

Portability through cloud‑ready deployment

🔹 System Architecture 
The system follows a layered, service‑oriented architecture consisting of:

Presentation Layer: Angular frontend handling user interaction and visualization

Application Layer: Go backend exposing RESTful APIs

Data Layer: SQL database for persistent storage

Analytics Layer: Python ML microservice for portfolio insights

This architecture ensures loose coupling, scalability, and ease of testing.

🔹 Machine Learning Component 
Machine learning is used as a decision‑support tool rather than a predictive trading engine.
The models analyze historical data to:

Assess portfolio risk

Evaluate diversification

Classify volatility trends

The focus is on explainability, reproducibility, and system integration, aligning with academic best practices.
